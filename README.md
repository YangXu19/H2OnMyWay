# H2OnMyWay
Project for McHacks 6

## The Hack
H2OnMyWay utilizes a Dragonboard to detect different levels of water flow in a pipe en route to a regional resevoir, and estimates the time for locals to reach the source, notifying them on SMS for water. Furthermore, the Dragonboard also gives the location of the watering source on the website H2OnMyWay.com, detailing nearby water sources and routes to them from your current location.
